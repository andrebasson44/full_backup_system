#Full Backup System

PROGRAM:  Full Backup System
AUTHOR: Andre Basson

DESCRIPTION: 
Typical FULL (image) backup script, which syncs data - files and directories listed in ./toBackup.txt - either between a remote and local host, local to local host, or local to remote host. ONLY in the first scenario data is PULLed from the remote host (as opposed to the remote host instigating the transfer by PUSHing the data). The other two scenarios PUSHes
data.

See INSTRUCTIONS, REQUIREMENTS and IMPORTANT notes in readme.txt.
